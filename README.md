### Mandatory Quality Agents (Always Run)
These 8 agents run on **EVERY task** to ensure quality:

1. **analyzer-1** - Requirements analysis
2. **validator-1** - Input validation
3. **validator-2** - Output validation
4. **formatter-1** - Code formatting
5. **formatter-2** - Documentation formatting
6. **error-handler-1** - Error handling enforcement
7. **linter-1** - Code quality and style
8. **verifier** - Final cross-verification

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Question
```
User: "What is REST API?"

Coordinator: Answers directly
Agents Spawned: 0
```

### Example 2: Create Feature
```
User: "Create a user login form"

Coordinator: Spawns 8 agents for implementation

Result: Complete login form with validation, tests, docs
Agents Spawned: 8
```

### Example 3: Complex System
```
User: "Build REST API with authentication"

Coordinator: Spawns 15 specialized agents

Result: Complete API with JWT auth, tests, docs, security hardening
Agents Spawned: 15
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Coordinator Decision Matrix

| Request Type | Action | Agents |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Simple question | Answer directly | 0 |
| Explanation | Explain directly | 0 |
| Small feature | Spawn specialists | 5-10 |
| Complex feature | Spawn full team | 10-20 |
| Large project | Spawn extended team | 20-50+ |

### Agent Workflow

```
User Request
    ↓
Coordinator
  🌐 Searches web for docs
  🧠 Analyzes with extended thinking
  📋 Plans implementation
  👥 Selects optimal agents
    ↓
Spawned Agents
  🌐 Search for specialty docs
  🧠 Think through their task
  💻 Implement completely
  ✅ Verify quality
    ↓
Coordinator
  📊 Shows dashboard
  🔧 Integrates outputs
  ✓ Delivers result
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Modify Agent Configuration
Edit `opencode.json` to add agents, adjust models, or change settings.

### Adjust System Behavior
Edit `OPENCODE.md` to modify delegation rules and strategies.

### Cost Optimization
The >10 agents rule automatically switches to Gemini models for 60-70% savings.

## 📊 Performance

| Task Size | Agents | Tokens | Time | Cost |
|-----------|--------|--------|------|------|
| Small | 5 | 10K | 30s | $0.03 |
| Medium | 8 | 25K | 1.5m | $0.08 |
| Large | 15 | 50K | 3m | $0.06* |
| Huge | 30 | 100K | 6m | $0.12* |
