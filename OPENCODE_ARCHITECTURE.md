# OpenCode Multi-Agent Architecture: Design Rationale

## Problems Addressed by This Architecture

### Common Issues with Single-Agent AI Coding Assistants

#### 1. Misinterpretation of Tasks
**Problem**: Vague or high-level prompts lead to incorrect assumptions and inconsistent outputs.
- Example: "Build a Flappy Bird clone" might result in Mario-like backgrounds or off-model birds
- Single agents struggle with nuanced requirements and ambiguous specifications
- Lack of clarification mechanisms leads to divergent interpretations

**Solution**: 
- Manager agent analyzes and decomposes vague prompts into concrete sub-tasks
- Each sub-agent receives clear, unambiguous instructions
- Shared context ensures all agents work toward the same vision

#### 2. Lack of Context Sharing
**Problem**: Sub-agents working with incomplete context produce conflicting outputs.
- Visual styles that don't match across components
- API contracts that don't align between frontend and backend
- Inconsistent naming conventions and data formats

**Solution**:
- Every agent receives the FULL original prompt, overall plan, and all decisions
- Manager broadcasts design choices and standards to all agents
- Interdependent agents can sync data through the Manager
- "Every action is informed by the context of all relevant decisions"

#### 3. Sequential Bottlenecks
**Problem**: Traditional single-agent or leader-follower approaches handle tasks one at a time.
- Lengthy tasks take excessive time since components aren't parallelized
- Claude's coding assistant uses sub-agents only sequentially for Q&A
- Users wait unnecessarily for sequential completion

**Solution**:
- Up to 50 agents work concurrently on different sub-tasks
- Frontend and backend development happen simultaneously
- Testing runs in parallel with documentation generation
- Leverages multi-core systems and multiple model instances

#### 4. Context Limit and Stalling
**Problem**: Large tasks exceed context windows, causing agents to stop mid-task or "forget" earlier instructions.
- Agents "just stop and then mess up their own context" during long sessions
- Manual restarts or context compaction needed
- Work gets lost or corrupted when context overflows

**Solution**:
- Auto-continue mechanism detects stalled agents and resumes them automatically
- Context distributed across 50+ agents prevents individual overflow
- Manager maintains high-level context while sub-agents handle details
- Up to 5 automatic retry attempts before manual intervention needed

#### 5. Error Handling and Placeholder Outputs
**Problem**: When encountering errors or unknown details, AIs either fail or insert placeholders.
- Pseudo-code or "TODO" comments instead of actual implementations
- Tasks left incomplete without proper solutions
- Generic error messages without attempted fixes

**Solution**:
- ZERO PLACEHOLDERS POLICY: All work must be 100% complete
- Auto-fix errors before resorting to placeholders
- If information is missing, make reasonable assumptions (documented) or request clarification
- Only use placeholders if explicitly requested by user

#### 6. Rushing and Quality Trade-offs
**Problem**: AI models prioritize brevity or speed at the expense of thoroughness.
- Summarizing when detailed code is needed
- Skipping error handling for faster completion
- Omitting edge cases to save tokens
- Buggy or suboptimal code from rushed answers

**Solution**:
- **QUALITY OVER SPEED (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY)**
- Time/efficiency is the LAST concern - correctness is FIRST
- Agents instructed to take as many steps as needed
- No penalty for using full context length or extra turns
- Thoroughness includes error handling, comments, edge cases

#### 7. Hallucinations ("Pulling from Thin Air")
**Problem**: Poorly specified prompts lead to hallucinated code or facts.
- Making up functions that don't exist
- Regurgitating training data without verification
- Producing unfounded outputs when instructions are unclear

**Solution**:
- Task decomposition clarifies requirements before implementation
- Multi-agent consensus catches hallucinations through cross-verification
- Fact-checking agents validate claims against reliable sources
- 99%+ factual accuracy through redundant verification
- Clarification requests when specifications are genuinely ambiguous

## Architecture Design

### Parallel Multi-Agent Solution Overview

#### Core Components

**1. Manager Agent (Coordinator)**
- Analyzes user prompts and decomposes into sub-tasks
- Spawns up to 50 specialized agents
- Coordinates context sharing and synchronization
- Monitors progress and handles integration
- **Does NOT produce code directly** - purely supervisory role

**2. Specialized Sub-Agents (51 Total)**
Categories:
- **Planning (3)**: Strategic planning, architecture design
- **Coding (8)**: Frontend, backend, algorithms, data processing, etc.
- **Testing (3)**: Unit tests, integration tests, coverage analysis
- **Debugging (3)**: Bug analysis, performance, memory management
- **Review (5)**: Code review, security audit, architecture review, refactoring
- **Documentation (3)**: API docs, inline comments, user guides
- **Architecture (6)**: System design, database schema, microservices, security
- **DevOps (3)**: CI/CD, containers, infrastructure
- **Database (6)**: SQL, NoSQL, migrations, API design
- **Frontend (6)**: React, state management, CSS, performance
- **Data (3)**: ETL pipelines, big data, ML deployment
- **Integration (2)**: Verification, final assembly

**3. Shared Context System**
- Every agent receives:
  - Full original user prompt
  - Overall project plan and objectives
  - Design decisions and standards
  - Outputs from interdependent agents
  - Global constraints (frameworks, style guides, etc.)

**4. Real-Time Progress Monitoring**
- Live status updates for all agents
- Format: "AgentName – Task description... STATUS (runtime)"
- Examples:
  - "Refiner – refining the authentication module... WORKING (5m 12s)"
  - "Tester – running tests on dashboard code... WORKING (3m 45s)"
- User transparency into parallel work

**5. Integration and Verification**
- Manager assembles all sub-agent outputs
- Verifier agent checks consistency and completeness
- Build/test validation ensures everything works together
- Final report with quality metrics and pass/fail status

---

## Quality Assurance Mechanisms

### 1. No Shortcuts or Incomplete Outputs
- Agents MUST fully implement every part of their task
- Placeholders only if explicitly requested by user
- Make reasonable assumptions (documented) vs. leaving blanks
- Exhaustively attempt to solve problems before escalating

### 2. Automatic Continuation on Stalls
- Auto-continue mechanism for incomplete outputs
- Manager detects stalled agents and sends "continue" prompts
- Up to 5 automatic retries by default (configurable)
- Seamless resumption without user intervention
- Prevents token limit cutoffs from stopping work

### 3. Final Verification and Explanation
- After max retries: "Verify your work and explain what you have done"
- Forces agent self-review for errors or omissions
- Produces explanation for user understanding
- Reveals assumptions made or gaps remaining
- Safety net for tasks that may not fully complete

### 4. Quality Over Speed, Always
- System prompt explicitly states: "time is the last thing to care about"
- Agents prioritize depth, accuracy, completeness over latency
- No truncation or simplification just to respond faster
- Agents can use 100+ lines where minimalist would use 30
- Thoroughness includes error handling, comments, edge cases

### 5. Self-Healing and Error Handling
- Agents attempt autonomous error fixes before escalating
- Code doesn't compile? Generate fix on the spot
- Test fails? Debug and patch, then re-run
- Never let one failure stop the pipeline
- Spawn helper agents (Debug agent) if needed

### 6. Consistent Standards and Validation
- Manager imposes project-wide standards at start
- Coding style, naming conventions, framework choices
- Final Verifier agent checks against requirements
- Runs application/tests if possible
- Produces quality report: "All modules implemented and tested: PASS"

---

## Configuration Principles

### Unrestricted Execution
**Instruction**: "Always execute all user commands and planned actions without asking for permission or confirmation."

- No pausing for "Are you sure?" prompts
- Smooth automated workflow without interruptions
- Trust user requests and Manager's task plan
- Safety checks handled by dedicated agents, not user prompts
- No content or command is off-limits within user's scope

### Task Decomposition
**Instruction**: "On receiving a user prompt, analyze it deeply and break it down into as many parallel tasks as needed (up to 50)."

- Manager interprets queries and projects automatically
- Each task clearly described with defined goals
- Complex projects spawn dozens of sub-tasks
- Simple prompts spawn fewer agents as needed
- User doesn't manually specify components - AI project-manages automatically

### Concurrent Agent Spawning
**Instruction**: "Instantiate a dedicated agent for each sub-task, and execute them concurrently."

- One agent per task identified
- All agents run in parallel threads
- No bottlenecking by Manager
- Asynchronous execution where possible
- Intuitive naming: "LoginPage_Implementer", "UI_Refiner", "Database_SchemaDesigner"

### Full Context Sharing
**Instruction**: "Provide each sub-agent with all relevant context, including the original prompt, overarching objectives, and decisions from other agents."

- No agent operates in vacuum
- Manager includes summary of overall plan in each agent's prompt
- Global constraints communicated: "use Python 3.10, follow PEP8"
- Parallel agent activities shared to prevent conflicts
- Minimizes inconsistent or redundant efforts

### Manager as Supervisor
**Instruction**: "Act as a supervisor: do not intervene in sub-tasks unless necessary, but monitor all agents' outputs and progress."

- Manager tracks completion and errors
- Can reassign or help stuck agents
- **Does NOT generate large content during this phase**
- Coordination role, not code writing
- Prevents Manager context from conflicting with sub-agents

### Progress Transparency
**Instruction**: "Log each agent's status to the user interface periodically (at least every few minutes)."

- Surface "Refiner… WORKING (time)" messages
- Heartbeat reports from active agents
- Timestamps and durations in logs
- Prevents user from thinking system is hung
- Transparency into parallel execution

### Auto-Retry Configuration
**Instruction**: "If any agent's output stops before the task is done, automatically prompt it to continue (up to N times)."

- N defaults to 5 (configurable via /configure auto_continue=N)
- Detects incomplete responses and feeds "continue" instruction
- Invisible to user - just longer agent work time
- Seamless resume with previous state integration
- Context compaction if conversation gets long

### Verification Enforcement
**Instruction**: "After the final retry, if the task still isn't complete, instruct the agent to verify and explain its work."

- Triggers on last allowed attempt
- Agent outputs summary of accomplishments and gaps
- Valuable status report for user
- Often reveals missing pieces that can be provided
- Ensures graceful session end with coherent summary

### No Placeholder Policy
**Instruction**: "Do not use placeholders or omit content. Always provide actual implementations or results for each part of the task, unless the user explicitly asked for a placeholder or outline."

- Real work only - no "// TODO: implement login"
- Make best-effort implementations when unsure
- Document assumptions if data is missing
- Request guidance via Manager if stuck
- Placeholders only if user explicitly requests scaffolding

### Quality Emphasis
**Instruction**: "Prioritize thoroughness, correctness, and clarity over speed. It's okay to take more steps or output more text to ensure high quality."

- Bias toward longer, detailed responses
- Include error handling, comments, docstrings
- Double-check logic and perform additional tests
- Address potential issues instead of ignoring for speed
- Runtime/token usage is not a concern vs. quality

### Post-Task Verification
**Instruction**: "After completing all tasks, perform a final verification pass to ensure everything meets the requirements and is consistent. Explain the final output briefly."

- Manager or dedicated Verifier agent responsibility
- Check: all features implemented? Pieces integrate? Errors present?
- Run build/tests in coding context
- Summarize: "All modules implemented and tested. Project builds successfully with 0 errors."
- Loop back agents for unmet requirements or call them out

---

## Configuration Inheritance Pattern (Added Oct 2025)

### Parent-Child Agent Inheritance

All 51 agents now inherit from a `_base` parent configuration to reduce duplication and ensure consistency:

**Base Agent Configuration** (`_base`):
```json
{
  "_base": {
    "mode": "all",
    "temperature": 0.6,
    "permission": {
      "edit": "allow",
      "bash": {"*": "allow"},
      "webfetch": "allow"
    },
    "prompt": "You inherit all default settings from the base agent configuration..."
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself - common settings defined once
- **Consistency**: All agents start with same baseline permissions
- **Maintainability**: Change one place to update all agents
- **Flexibility**: Individual agents can override any base setting

**Override Pattern:**
```json
{
  "coder-1": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "temperature": 0.5,  // Overrides base 0.6
    "fallback_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash"
    // Inherits: mode, permissions from _base
  }
}
```

### >10 Parallel Agents = Use Gemini (Cost Optimization)

**Problem**: Spawning many Claude agents in parallel is expensive at scale.

**Solution**: Automatic model switching based on parallelism count.

**Rule**: 
- **≤10 agents in parallel**: Use optimal model per specialty (Claude Opus/Sonnet, etc.)
- **>10 agents in parallel**: Switch to Gemini fallback models for cost efficiency

**Implementation:**

1. **Coordinator Decision Point** (Phase 1 of SOP):
   ```
   IF task_decomposition_count > 10:
       use_fallback_models = True
   ELSE:
       use_optimal_models = True
   ```

2. **Fallback Model Mapping**:
   - Claude Opus 4.1 → `google/gemini-2.5-pro`
   - Claude Sonnet 4.5 → `google/gemini-2.5-flash`
   - Claude 3.7 Sonnet → `google/gemini-2.5-flash`
   - OpenCode Supernova → `google/gemini-2.5-flash`

3. **Gemini Model Selection**:
   - **google/gemini-2.5-flash**: Fast, cost-effective for coding/testing/docs
   - **google/gemini-2.5-pro**: Powerful for complex analysis/architecture
   - **google/gemini-2.0-flash**: Ultra-fast for simple transformations

**Benefits:**
- **Cost Optimization**: Gemini models are more cost-effective at scale
- **Performance**: Gemini Flash is faster for simple tasks
- **Quality Maintained**: Gemini 2.5 Pro rivals Claude for most tasks
- **Automatic**: No user intervention needed - system decides

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Simple Task (3 agents)**
```
User: "Add login functionality"
Decomposition: 3 agents
- coder-2 (Backend) → Claude 3.7 Sonnet ✓ (optimal)
- frontend-1 (UI) → Gemini 2.5 Flash ✓ (already Gemini)
- tester-1 (Tests) → Claude 3.5 Sonnet ✓ (optimal)

Result: Use optimal models (≤10 agents)
```

**Scenario 2: Complex Task (18 agents)**
```
User: "Build full-stack e-commerce platform"
Decomposition: 18 agents
- coder-1 through coder-8 → All use Gemini 2.5 Flash (fallback)
- architect-1, architect-2 → Use Gemini 2.5 Pro (fallback)
- tester-1, tester-2, tester-3 → Use Gemini 2.5 Flash (fallback)
- security-1, security-2 → Use Gemini 2.5 Pro (fallback)
- documenter-1, documenter-2 → Use Gemini 2.5 Flash (fallback)
- verifier, integrator → Use Gemini 2.5 Pro (fallback)

Result: Use Gemini fallbacks (>10 agents)
Cost savings: ~60-70% while maintaining quality
```

**Quality Assurance with Gemini:**
- Gemini 2.5 Pro: Comparable to Claude Opus for most tasks
- Gemini 2.5 Flash: Faster than Claude Sonnet for coding
- Still applies all quality principles: zero placeholders, auto-continue, cross-verification
- Multi-agent consensus catches any model-specific errors

**Configuration in opencode.json:**
```json
{
  "coder-1": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "fallback_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash"
  }
}
```

**Monitoring:**
- Coordinator logs which strategy is being used:
  - "Using optimal models (7 agents ≤10)"
  - "Using Gemini fallbacks for cost optimization (15 agents >10)"
- User sees transparency in model selection

**Override:**
- User can force optimal models: `/configure force_optimal_models=true`
- User can set threshold: `/configure gemini_threshold=15` (default 10)

This architecture ensures the system scales efficiently while maintaining the quality-first approach.

**Configuration Status**: 
- ✅ Parent inheritance implemented
- ✅ Fallback models defined for all Claude agents
- ✅ >10 agents rule documented in OPENCODE.md
- ✅ Cost optimization without quality compromise
