# OpenCode Coordinator Completion Fix - Summary

## Problem You Had

Your OpenCode coordinator (Gemini 2.5 Pro) kept stopping mid-task:

```
Example from your session:
Coordinator: "Okay, that's the problem. There are no test files..."
Coordinator: "Here's my updated plan..."  
Coordinator: "I'm marking the branding task as complete..."
→ STOPPED (never actually did the work!)

You had to type: "Don't stop until your task is done"
```

## Solution Applied

### Three-Layer Enforcement System

**Layer 1: Ultra-Strict Rules (Beginning)**
- Sees this FIRST before any response
- Explicitly forbidden from planning without execution
- Must DO work, not just describe it

**Layer 2: Completion Checklist (Middle)**
- Mandatory 8-point checklist
- Must verify before declaring complete
- Production-ready requirements

**Layer 3: Response Blocker (End)**
- Checks before EVERY response
- 5 mandatory questions
- Must pass all to respond

### Configuration Changes

**File**: `/Users/ai/.config/opencode/opencode.json`

1. ✅ Added ultra-strict enforcement to coordinator
2. ✅ Added response blocker to coordinator  
3. ✅ Reduced coordinator temperature to 0.3
4. ✅ Enhanced base agent completion requirements

**Verification**:
```bash
grep -c "ULTRA-STRICT" ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json  # Should be 1
grep -c "RESPONSE" ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json     # Should be 1+
```

## How to Use

### Normal Operation

Just use OpenCode normally. The coordinator should now:
- Complete ALL work before responding
- Test everything it creates
- Remove all placeholders
- Deliver production-ready results

### If It Still Stops Early

**Use these commands** (from `FORCE_COMPLETION_COMMANDS.txt`):

**Basic**:
```
Continue - task is NOT complete
```

**Aggressive**:
```
No planning - DO IT NOW. Complete everything.
```

**Nuclear**:
```
⛔ STOP. Complete 100% of work before responding.
All code written, tested, zero placeholders, production-ready.
```

## Files Created

1. **`opencode.json`** (updated)
   - Coordinator with 3-layer enforcement
   - All 96 agents with completion requirements

2. **`COMPLETION_ENFORCEMENT.md`**
   - Full documentation of enforcement system
   - Test cases and examples

3. **`STOP_COORDINATOR_STOPPING.md`**
   - Detailed troubleshooting guide
   - Examples of wrong vs. correct behavior
   - Last resort solutions

4. **`FORCE_COMPLETION_COMMANDS.txt`**
   - Quick reference of commands
   - Copy/paste ready
   - Escalating severity levels

5. **`COMPLETION_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
   - Overview of what was done
   - Quick reference

## What Changed

### Before
```
User: "Add tests for authentication"

Coordinator:
"Okay, I see there are no tests.
Here's my plan:
1. Create test files
2. Write tests  
3. Run tests

I'll update the todo."
→ STOPS (nothing done)
```

### After
```
User: "Add tests for authentication"

Coordinator:
*Creates test files*
*Writes 15 test cases*
*Runs tests - all passing*
*Verifies zero placeholders*
*Confirms production-ready*

"Completed authentication tests:
- auth.test.ts with 15 tests
- All passing ✓
- 95% coverage
- Production-ready"
→ STOPS (after completing)
```

---

## Enforcement Active

Run this to verify:

```bash
cd ~/.config/opencode
python3 << 'ENDSCRIPT'
import json
with open('opencode.json', 'r') as f:
    config = json.load(f)
prompt = config['agent']['coordinator']['prompt']
print("Layer 1:", "✅" if "ULTRA-STRICT" in prompt else "❌")
print("Layer 2:", "✅" if "COMPLETION ENFORCEMENT" in prompt else "❌")  
print("Layer 3:", "✅" if "BEFORE YOU RESPOND" in prompt else "❌")
print("Temp:", config['agent']['coordinator'].get('temperature', 0.7))
ENDSCRIPT
```

Expected output:
```
Layer 1: ✅
Layer 2: ✅
Layer 3: ✅
Temp: 0.3
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### What Coordinator SHOULD Do

1. Receive user request
2. Identify all work needed
3. **DO all the work** (not just plan it)
4. Test everything
5. Remove placeholders
6. Verify production-ready
7. **THEN respond** with completed work

### What Coordinator Should NOT Do

1. ❌ Make plans without executing
2. ❌ Explain problems without solving
3. ❌ Update todos instead of doing work
4. ❌ Stop with "I'll do X next"
5. ❌ Deliver untested code

---

## Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when:**

✅ Coordinator completes tasks without reminders
✅ No more "here's my plan" (then stops)
✅ Code is tested before delivery
✅ Zero placeholders in outputs
✅ Minimal "continue" commands needed

**If you still see:**

❌ Stopping with plans
❌ Explaining instead of executing  
❌ Untested code delivery
❌ Frequent "continue" needed

→ Use commands from `FORCE_COMPLETION_COMMANDS.txt`
→ See `STOP_COORDINATOR_STOPPING.md` for troubleshooting

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**What was fixed**: Coordinator stopping mid-task

**How it was fixed**: 3-layer completion enforcement system

**Files modified**: 1 (opencode.json)

**Files created**: 4 (documentation)

**Expected result**: Coordinator completes tasks before responding

**If it fails**: Use force completion commands

**Last resort**: Switch coordinator to Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

**Your OpenCode coordinator now has maximum completion enforcement active.**
