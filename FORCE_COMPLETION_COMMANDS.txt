║  FORCE COMPLETION COMMANDS - Copy/Paste When Needed         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

IF COORDINATOR STOPS MID-TASK, USE ONE OF THESE:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 BASIC COMPLETION COMMANDS

Continue - task is NOT complete

Execute the plan, don't just describe it

Complete ALL work before responding

Finish everything, then respond once

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔥 AGGRESSIVE COMMANDS (if basic doesn't work)

No planning - DO IT NOW. Complete everything.

Your response blocker should have stopped you. Complete 100% of work before responding.

Stop explaining. Start executing. Finish the entire task.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💣 NUCLEAR OPTION (if nothing else works)

⛔ STOP. Your completion checks failed:
- Request NOT 100% complete
- Code NOT tested
- Work NOT production-ready

DO NOT respond until:
✅ All code written AND tested
✅ All tests passing
✅ Zero placeholders
✅ Production-ready deliverables
✅ User can use immediately

Complete EVERYTHING now.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 VERIFICATION COMMAND

Check your completion checklist now. Are ALL items complete?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 EXAMPLES

Instead of: "I'll update the todo list..."
Tell it: "No - COMPLETE the actual work first"

Instead of: "Here's my plan to fix this..."
Tell it: "Execute the plan now, don't describe it"

Instead of: "The problem is X, so I need to Y..."
Tell it: "Fix X by doing Y - complete it now"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 WHAT "COMPLETE" MEANS

✅ Code written, tested, and verified working
✅ All tests passing
✅ Zero TODO/FIXME/placeholders
✅ Production-ready (user can use immediately)
✅ Documentation complete

❌ Plans made but not executed
❌ Problems identified but not solved
❌ Todos updated but work not done
❌ Code written but not tested

QUICK REFERENCE:
• Coordinator stopping early? → Use basic commands
• Still stopping? → Use aggressive commands
• STILL stopping? → Use nuclear option
• Can't get it to work? → See STOP_COORDINATOR_STOPPING.md
